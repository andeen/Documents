* Current setup
** The vision: 
   - the group not to be preoccupied with programming
   - the group not to be (mutually) specialized
   - the group not to cooperate
   - the group not to assist across business units, unless related to outspoken risk targets
   - build further/increase dependencies on the FIS Adaptiv infrastructure 
** Short-term ramifications:
   - technical setup characterized by poorly implemented excel/VBA -> no interface between core applications 
   - vast amounts of time spent with processing of data, (FIS) system support and inefficient reporting
   - Ad-hoc implementations of basic tools, lacking context
** Long-term ramifications:
   - Outsourcing of business intelligence and real competencies (->FIS)
   - Loss of intellectual property
   - Inability to be self-sufficient  
* New setup 
** 

* Proposition
** Front Office Quant desk:
   - Responsible for in-markets software developement platform across business units
   - Software covering
     - Trade support
     - Pricing
